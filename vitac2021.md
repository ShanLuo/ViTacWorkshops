# ICRA 2021 ViTac Workshop: Trends and Challenges in Visuo-Tactile Perception

Abstract: This is the 3rd time for us to organise the ViTac workshop in the ICRA conferences and will be a milestone after two consecutive ViTac workshops. This workshop aims to put the visuo-tactile perception under the spotlight by investigating the current trends and providing guidance towards possible future directions in the field. Humans couple vision and touch tightly in daily tasks like grasping and manipulation. Similarly, multimodal perception also plays a key role for robots to execute tasks in unstructured environments. In recent decades, there has been much advancement in integrating vision and tactile sensing for robots, both in hardware and software.  In the ICRA 2019 ViTac workshop, we highlighted the recent development of optical tactile sensors by integrating visual cameras in tactile sensors for multimodal and cross-modal perception. In the ICRA 2020 ViTac workshop, we drew attention to how vision and tactile sensing together contribute to closing the perception-action loop. This proposed full-day workshop will encompass recent progress in the area of visuo-tactile perception, particularly the trends both in the hardware and algorithms. It will further enhance active collaboration and address challenges for this important topic and applications.
